Aside from skipping ahead a year in elementary school, my life remained rather uneventful until I was admitted to [Stuyvesant High School](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuyvesant_High_School). There I had a fantastic experience participating in perhaps the best [high school computer science program](http://www.stuycs.org/), holding a leadership position on one of the best [FIRST robotics teams](http://stuypulse.com/), and much, much more. I'll be writing a post (possibly many) about my Stuyvesant experience sometime soon.\n\nAt Cornell, I've joined the extremely successful [Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](http://www.cuauv.org/about) robotics team where I've worked on some interesting computer vision problems relating to stereo vision and camera undistortion. I also had a great time singing bass and barbershop tags with [The Chai Notes](http://www.thechainotes.com/) for a semester, fighting briefly on the [Taekwondo Team](http://orgsync.rso.cornell.edu/org/taekwondo), bonding with members of Cornell's [Intervarsity Christian Fellowship](https://orgsync.com/72151/chapter), and indulging in a healthy dose of [anime and gaming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls32eMfGgeg).\n\nMy experience in the software industry outside of class began in the summer of 2012 when a [friend from robotics](www.blakeelias.com) referred me to a position at [Brainlink](www.brainlink.com), a small IT company where I developed workflow optimization tools. I recruited another [friend from robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/peter-jasko/54/91b/924) and, armed with what I learned from AP Computer Science class, dove headfirst into the ConnectWise API and CardScan SDK. Sometime in the future you can expect a more detailed post about my experience at Brainlink.\n\nThe next summer, I landed an internship at YC backed electronic parts search engine [Octopart](http://www.octopart.com). Since my time at Brainlink, I had grown a lot as a software engineer, and jumping into development of Octopart's Python parts classifier was very painless (actually quite pleasant). Working with another [friend from robotics](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/eric-lam/57/9a6/338), I expanded the classifier's capabilities with regex and explored using machine learning techniques to partially automate the classification process, all the while falling madly in love with Python. You can also expect a future post about my experience at Octopart - also, they're [hiring](http://octopart.com/jobs)!\n\nThis summer, I'm working at [Tesla Motors](http://www.teslamotors.com/), a company I am confident will change the world (and it seems some [big players](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-most-important-automaker-20140620-story.html) agree with me). Once my internship is over, I'll have a _ton_ to talk about. Until then, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVbuk3jizGM) is a teaser for one of the projects I'm working on...\n\nI've worked on a number of very interesting (at least to me) projects as part of my computer science classes at Stuyvesant, including a [particle physics simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MQZ_EhBUIE) and a [music visualizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3eHqx43R88), the former of which gained me some [press attention](http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3757841). Using some of the skills I picked up while working on the visualizer and while working at Octopart, I also threw together a class on [Machine Learning and Audio Analysis](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/teachers/darylsew/bio.html) which I taught at [MIT Splash](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html), a weekend at MIT where college students teach cool, short classes to high school students. Since then, I've been a part of some very talented teams at various hackathons (one of which we managed to [win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=py8T_S0Uzxw)). I have quite a few side projects in the making - here are just a few:\n\n- A web app for location based sound data visualization (think heatmaps for sound bites)\n- An anti-game parody of sorts that breaks all game conventions ([reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2ac57k/what_video_game_clich%C3%A9_drives_you_insane/) has some commentary on game clichés)\n- An anti-lock brake system for bicycles\n- An electric bicycle mod with regenerative braking\n\nI would love to do an electric vehicle conversion, but there's no way I'd have the funds for that, unlike [JB Straubel](https://energy.stanford.edu/people/speaker/jb-straubel), Tesla CTO, who set an electric vehicle racing world record with the [Porsche 944](http://www.evalbum.com/223) he converted in college (sooo jealous...).\n\n##Why are you blogging?\n\nI used to write a lot back when I had nothing else to do. In fact, I even managed to make some cash back in _middle school_ publishing articles on [Associated Content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Voices) and [Triond](http://www.triond.com/) (note: fun, but wouldn't recommend!). I like writing. A lot. For an audience, though. I kept a private journal for a few years in high school, but it was never much more than a medium for letting off steam; since I had no audience, I had little motivation to focus on writing quality. I figure a tech blog could be a more productive way to satiate my appetite for writing, especially since I don't expect to take many more (if any) writing classes during my undergraduate career.\n\nMy main goal here, though, is giving back to the Internet community. As the old adage goes, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants - although I did admittedly have a huge headstart from [Michael Zamansky](http://cestlaz.github.io/)'s awesome classes, much of my progress in personal projects and internships is owed to (well, aside from Stack Overflow) _bloggers_, inquisitive people who build amazing things with high entry barrier technologies, then share how-tos with the world that enable novices to leverage those technologies. By logging my adventures in technology, I intend to save time for the countless others who will inevitably struggle with the same issues that I did. If anything on my blog helps you create something cool, I'd love to hear about it - you can reach me at darylsew@gmail.com or leave any questions/commentary in the comments section.\n\nPlus, I've had a number of friends come to me asking for [pointers](http://xkcd.com/138/) on how to do certain things I managed to figure out while working on projects, and detailed writeups of the stuff I'm working with could save me a lot of time explaining myself.\n \n\n##What are you blogging about?\n\nAs you might be able to tell from the above, I've spent a lot of time working with really brilliant engineers in a variety of fields and work settings. I'll definitely be blogging about my experiences working with different groups, mixing in some commentary on the human factors of programming a la [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com). I'll also cover some of the technologies I really love - expect to see at least a few of the following:\n\n- Python \n\t- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (maybe a bit of C++ here too)\n- JavaScript\n\t- [Box2D.js](http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/), [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/), [three.js](http://threejs.org/), [HTML Canvas](http://diveintohtml5.info/canvas.html), [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), and my favorite, [famous.js](http://famo.us)\n- Mouseless everything\n\t- Vim\n    \t- [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), [delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate), [NERDtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), [ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips), [Vim-LaTeX](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/), [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/)\n    - [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) for mouseless web browsing\n- Unix Tools\n    \n    \nAlong with, of course, any other neat library or gadget that tickles my fancy.\n\nI'll probably share some views on political issues or commentary on current events, but that won't be a priority - the world has enough [pundits](http://blog.codinghorror.com/yes-but-what-have-you-done/).","html":"<h2 id=\"whoareyou\">Who are you?</h2>\n\n<p>I'm Daryl Sew, a sophomore studying Computer Science with a hint of Electrical Engineering and Game Design at Cornell University. </p>\n\n<p>I was born in Georgetown, Guyana and moved to NYC with my family at the age of 4.
